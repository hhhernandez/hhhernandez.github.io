I've been working on making a <a href="https://wiki.openag.media.mit.edu/personal_food_computers">Personal Food Computer</a> as seen on MIT's <a href= "https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/">OpenAg initiative</a>. Living in Abu Dhabi makes it difficult to source parts and materials that are needed for the build.

I am documenting sources for parts and materials I have used during this build both from local and international sources. I hope that this provides assistance for those in need.
