I've been working on making a Food Computer 2 as seen on MIT's OpenAg initiative. Living in Abu Dhabi makes it difficult to source parts and materials that are needed for the build.

I am documenting sources for parts and materials I have used during this build both from local and international sources. I hope that this provides assistance for those in need.
